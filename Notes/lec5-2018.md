# Notes
We will learn about LLVM IR into which C is translated, and then see how LLVM IR goes into Assembly. LLVM IR is an intermediate representation used by LLVM.

## LLVM IR Primer
LLVM IR has infinite "registers" which are like C variables. It however has a simple instruction format in the structure "destination = opcode sources." Control flow is implemented using conditional and unconditional branches. It also has functions.

Registers are % followed by name like %0, %1, %2, ... Register names are local to every LLVM IR function.

Types: i int, i1 => 1 bit, i64 => 64 bit. You can have type "label" too which is for a basic block. Basic blocks combine simple instructions whose code execution is always sequential (no jump instructions or jump targets between them).

### Straight Line C Code: No conditionals or loops
